# In order to access this file i have shared you will have to aquire the dv processing, they have a program that plays back a adet4 file as if it was actually there.
# Using this recording data you should be able to write an algoritm that determines which "robot" and where each robot is.
# i have the frequency set to 2hz for robot 1
# i have the frequency set to 3hz for robot 2
# i have the frequency set to 4hz for robot 3
# could probably use a noise filter.
# and a pca algorithm
# yeah.
# i don't know
# i got an exam on thursday. i'll think about this more after that.
# the website that has the scripts you need is called https://dv-processing.inivation.com/master/index.html go there follow their instructions to download the software. then you can play the video with
# python python/samples/file_playback.py -f "C:\YOUR FILE PATH\my_recording.aedat4"
# and in theory you should be able to have your algorithm analize the recording as if it was happening in real time imho
# once you have one that works hit me up. submit a pull request and we can add a branch.
# Hopefully i am doing okay with this i am way out of my depth on this.
